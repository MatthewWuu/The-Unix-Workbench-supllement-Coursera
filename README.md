This file $\rightarrow$ ***"UNIX programming course on COURSERA"***  was designed for those who are taking the elementary GNU/linux_bash_programming course on Coursera, namely [The Unix Workbence](https://www.coursera.org/learn/unix/home/welcome). 

The initial propuse to wirte this article is to collect the **key points/takeways** and also add some **extensions** which i thought would be helpful for understanding during the learning process. As such, some parts such as "*enumerating all sorts of command lines*" are slimmed down(you can straightly look them up when you need); some interesting parts like "*what's the difference between 'origin' and 'master' on git*" will be expanded.

You can take this as an extra note, so just help yourself to it because the distribution of konwledge <u>*is not copyrightable*</u>. This project is still building up at this stage, please correct me if you caught any mistakes ; )
